## Problem Statement:

Design a `class` that represents a bank account with the following attributes:

- `Depositor's Name`
- `Account Number`
- `Withdrawal Amount`
- `Current Account Balance`

The class should have the following member functions:

- A function to set the `initial values` for the account.
- A function to `deposit` money into the account.
- A function to `withdraw` money, which checks the balance before completing the transaction.
- A function to display the `account holder's name` and the `current balance`.

Implement this program utilizing the principles of `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++`.
